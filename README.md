============Flappy bird AI============

Version 1.0

==Description==

When running the program three options will be given in the console. The console will prompt to run the AI training program or the pre-trained AI, or, you can try out the game for yourself. 

The velocity the walls travel at increases by 1 every 10 walls passed. 

The AI uses NEAT neural network with 4 inputs: the y position of the bird, the y position the bottom of the top pipe, the y position of the top of the bottom pipe, as well as the velocity of the walls and 1 output: whether to flap wings or not.

Image folder contains sprites for the game. The theme of the game is based on the dressrosa arc of One Piece. The background and end screen images are taken from google (from the actual anime) and the rest of the images are drawn by me. 

The text file contains the necessary configurations for the NEAT algorithm to work. 

Controls: Press space or click to flap wings.
