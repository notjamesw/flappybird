# flappybird
flappybird base game and NEAT AI 

============Flappy bird AI============

Contributors: notjamesw

Version 1.2 (file searching method adjusted to allow for .exe file)

~~Version 1.1 (fixed bug where new game starts at the same speed as old game)~~

~~Version 1.0 (first complete version, includes a trained AI)~~

==Description==

When running the program three options will be given in the console. The console will prompt to run the AI training program or the pre-trained AI, or, you can try out the game for yourself. The program will run in a continuous loop until "1" is entered into the console. 

The velocity the walls travel at increases by 1 every 10 walls passed. 

The AI uses NEAT neural network with 4 inputs: the y position of the bird, the y position the bottom of the top pipe, the y position of the top of the bottom pipe, as well as the velocity of the walls and 1 output: whether to flap wings or not.

Image folder contains sprites for the game. The theme of the game is based on the dressrosa arc of One Piece. The background and end screen images are taken from google (from the actual anime) and the rest of the images are drawn by me. 

The text files contains the necessary configurations for the NEAT algorithm to work. 

Controls: Press space or left click to flap wings. 

==Additional Information==
